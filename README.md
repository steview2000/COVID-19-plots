# COVID-19-plots

Here is some regularly updated analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The data are from: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

## The growth rate of infection


Data are provided for number of the number of _cumulated infected_, _recovered_ and _deceased_ patients.
We first consider the number of infected people. With a constant infection rate and an infinite
reservoir of infectable people,  this number should grow nearly exponentially. Therefore, we plot
the data on a linear x-axis and a logarithmic y-axis. In this way an exponential growth of the
infections shows up as straight lines.

We see in the top figure, the infection data for 6 different countries. Most of them do not show
straight lines over the entire range. The relative infection rate can be calculated by dividing the
daily increase by the number of infections. However, as the data scatter, also these numbers scatter
significantly and trends are difficult to grasp. Therefore, we fit polynomials of 4th order to the
logarithm of the infections. The 1st derivative of these polynomials mark the effective
infection rates and are plotted as solid lines in the lower plot. Note, one should not overinterpret
the data, since small fluctuations in the data get picked up by the fits and thus show unreal
trends. However, one can clearly see, how the infection rates in Italy decrease albeit slowly,
steadily.
